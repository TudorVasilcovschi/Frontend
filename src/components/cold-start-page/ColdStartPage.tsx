              Books are our best friends. When I am sick and in bed, unable to play, books give me company. I also have
              nice bedside books that I read before I fall asleep at night. I love to read detective and fantasy stories
              in the English language. I like reading old books like the Sherlock Holmes series by Arthur Conan Doyle. I
              also like reading short stories in Tamil and Hindi. Sometimes when I am reading I get so enchanted and
              engrossed that I even forget to eat my dinner.
